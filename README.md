# ComposeGDK
The goal of Compose Game Developement Kit, is to provide a Multiplatform Game SDK based on Compose. It is a 2D Game Engine ideal to build oldschool games like Platform, Puzzle or Fight Games.

## Disclaimer
This is not a Google or JetBrains project, this not supported by any company. Given the experimental nature of this project, I can't guarantee much support at this stage. I hope we can build a community so that this become a strong library.

## Install
Compose GDK requires Java 11 or above. It can be installed with homebrew (MacOS)
```
$ brew install java11
$ sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-11.jdk
```
verify the version is correct
```
$ /usr/libexec/java_home
$ java -version
```

then run for MacOS ðŸ’»:

```
$ ./gradlew run
```

then run for Android ðŸ¤–:

```
$ ./gradlew installDebug
```

# Main principles
## GameObject
the most simplest object is GameObject, it has coordinates and size, this can be extended to place more complexe object on the screen, such as GameImage.

## GameCanvas
The GameObjects are placed on the Game Canvas

## Animation / Scroll
Both Horizontal and Vertical scroll have been implemented, they support speed which can be use to create a parallax effect

## Collision detector
The collision dectetor is very simple at this stage, it help to determine if 2 objects has entered in collision, this is useful to prevent object going too far, determine if the hero has encourter an ennemie or to implement gravity.

## Controllers
A Simple Keyboard controller that have 4 directions is implemented

## Score
a basic score controller has been implemented
